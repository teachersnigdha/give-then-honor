```
The rain came,
The sea roared,
The tide is roaring from afar,
What a wonderful way to screw people over.

The dusty house is gone,
Sleeping great drum,
A little creature is happy,
The wind blew.

Everyone was shocked,
Those who woke up,
Risking his life,
If you keep it, you will die.

Dear government,
Para made friends,
Looking at the past,
Belu was vigilant.

How many institution services,
Great religion,
Sorrowful sorrow.
Hope burns.

Respect them,
Giving is our religion,
Day and night
Who does the work.

Animals or birds or humans,
Different without leaving,
Life goes on,
It is an honor to give him.

It consists of five elements,
As our body,
The five souls are one,
There will be Baikuntha Pur.
